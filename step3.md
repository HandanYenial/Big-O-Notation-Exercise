Answer the following questions

True or false: n^2 + n is O(n^2). True

True or false: n^2 * n is O(n^3). True

True or false: n^2 + n is O(n). False

What’s the time complexity of the .indexOf array method? O(n)
      indexOf() – also runs in linear time. It iterates through the internal array and checks each element one by one, so the time complexity for this operation always requires O(n) time.

What’s the time complexity of the .includes array method? O(n)

What’s the time complexity of the .forEach array method? O(n)

What’s the time complexity of the .sort array method? O(n log(n))
      Arrays. sort(Object[]) is based on the TimSort algorithm, giving us a time complexity of O(n log(n)).

What’s the time complexity of the .unshift array method? O(n)
      unshift() has a Linear Time Complexity and is O(n). The Array. pop() and Array. shift() methods which are used to remove an element from the end and beginning of an array respectively, work similarly

What’s the time complexity of the .push array method? O(1)

What’s the time complexity of the .splice array method? O(n)
      can be O(1) if it is at the end 

What’s the time complexity of the .pop array method? O(1)

What’s the time complexity of the Object.keys() function? O(n)
